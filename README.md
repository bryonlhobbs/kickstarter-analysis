# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

###Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to determine how other Kickstarter campaigns for plays and other theater productions fared based on when the campaign was started and based on the goal amount requested.  Through careful analysis, we were able to determine what months and goal amounts were optimal for Kickstarter success in this genre of campaign.  The refinement of this analysis to only plays and theater productions was to ensure we only looked at a data that was meaningful to Louise after her experience with her “Fever” Kickstarter campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

First, we analyzed the data based on campaign launch date.  This was important, as we wanted to look at trends based annual cycles.  What we found was that many projects start their campaigns in May and June.  The most successes happened during these months, as well.  The month with the lowest number of successful campaigns was December.  December also had almost as many failed campaigns as successfully ones.  No other month had as small of a difference between the number of successful campaigns and failed campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Next, we analyzed plays by their goal amounts.  The first thing that jumps out is that there were no canceled Kickstarter campaigns for plays.  Another trend is that there were fewer campaigns at the higher amounts listed than at lower amounts.  The three lowest categories for Goal Amount were the three with the most campaigns.  The percentage successful line on the graph shows a downward trend, with the percentage failed line being the inverse of success, due to no canceled play Kickstarters.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One challenge that someone could encounter is to determine what ways to categorize the data would be the most meaningful.  I personally wondered why we analyzed all theater Kickstarters by launch date, but only plays by goal amount.  Why wouldn’t we only look at plays consistently, since that subcategory was available to us for the entire dataset?  

##Results

One conclusions that can be drawn from the data about launch date is that May and June are the months with the highest likelyhood to launch a theater Kickstarter.  This is based on the fact that failed and canceled data remains relatively consistent through the calendar year while we see a spike in the number of successful campaigns in these months.  The other trend based on launch date is that December is the least successful time to start a campaign.  This could be due to holiday spending and year-end budgeting of finances.

The main trend is that campaigns are more successful when they ask for less money.  This is demonstrated by the negative overall slope of the trend line for percentage of successful play-based Kickstarter campaigns. This is because larger campaigns need more people to contribute or larger donors.  Inversely, smaller campaigns are easier to finance.  

This data is not without limitations. One main limitation is that there are very few campaigns for large amounts.  Thus, more data in those categories would allow for more thorough analysis.  

Some other visualizations we could create based on the data would be to analyze the success of plays by country.  That way would could focus on the cultural impact of starting a campaign in the United States to better help Louise strategize.  Another way is to analyze the number of backers and the average donation for successful campaigns versus failed campaigns.  This would allow us to better understand what type of backers to target with marketing for Louise’s Kickstarter.  We could also analyze the data based on staff picks and spotlights, to see if there is any correlation tone found in that data.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
